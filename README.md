# thermal-hydraulics-analysis-of-AP1000

In this project, I conducted thermal hydraulics analysis of the Westinghouse AP1000 reactor. There were 3 sections of this project.

Section 1: I investigated the power, temperature, pressure, quality, and enthalpy distribution for average channel. I also investigated the flow characteristics at 0%, 50%, 100%, and 150% power levels for flow rates from 0% to 150% of the rated flow rate.

Section 2: I investigated the power, temperature, pressure, quality, and enthalpy distribution for hot channel and calculated DNBR for different power levels.

Section 3: I investigated the radial temperature distribution for hot channel.
